# MNIST Digit Classification

## Description
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of image classification, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The goal is to create a robust model capable of accurately predicting the digit in an unseen image.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-digit-classification.git
cd mnist-digit-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
You can start by exploring the data and training the model using the Jupyter notebooks provided in the notebooks/ directory.

For instance, to run the data exploration notebook:

jupyter notebook notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb

To train the model, execute the following script:
python src/train.py


 #Model Overview
The model used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following layers:

Input layer: Takes 28x28 pixel images as input.
Convolutional layers: Extract features from the input images.
Pooling layers: Downsample the feature maps.
Fully connected layers: Map the features to the output space.
Output layer: A softmax layer with 10 units corresponding to the 10 digit classes (0-9)

# Results
The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset. Below are some of the key metrics:

Accuracy: X%
Precision: X%
Recall: X%
